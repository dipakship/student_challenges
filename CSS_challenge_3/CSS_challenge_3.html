        <h1>Cheese</h1>

        <p>
            Cheese is tasty. It's a delicious snack. It's is made with various types of milk, 
            depending on what part of the world you live in. There are also dairy-free cheeses.

        <p>
            Cheese is typically made through the process of curding milk. Today, this is done in factories! <br> 
            First, the milk is pouring into big containers called vats and then bacteria is added to the milk to convert lactose into lactic acid. <br>
            Then, an enzyme called rennet is added to "naturally" curdle the milk. <br>
            
            In the past, rennet was obtained from the stomach of young cows, 
            however now genetically made bacteria and yeast is primarily used to make the enzyme. <br><br>

            Fun Fact! Did you know cheese was discovered by accident?
